# The project is live and can be viewed [here.](https://shopify-shoppies-mchaudhry.netlify.app/)

# Extra Features I Added 
The features I choose to add were: 
 * Save nomination lists if the user leaves the page
 * Animations for loading, adding/deleting movies, notifications

# Notes 
This project was built using reactJS and I used localStorage to save the users previous nominations. My perspective on undertaking this project was to give a very simple, yet nice UI. The code has been written with the emphasis on breaking the UI into components to really use what reactJS is all about. I hope you enjoy the website as much as I enjoyed coding it and designing it!
